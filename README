Some Python tools for analyzing codon/nucleutide/amino-acid usage in an organism. Currently only for E. coli.

License is GPLv3.

Requires BioPython.

Takes GenBank files as input.

For now includes two tools:

  Usage Analyzer
    Calculates nucleotide/codon/amino-acid usage from all coding sequences in an annotated genbank file.
    Types of usage calculations currently supported:
      amino acid usage
      codon usage
      codon usage per position
      codon usage per amino acid
      nucleotide usage per position

    Planned calculations:
      nucleotide usage
      nucleotide usage per amino acid
      nucleotide usage per amino acid per position
      amino acid usage per position
      codon usage per amino acid per position

  Seq Generator: 

Try "./usage_analyzer_cmd.py -h" to get started.

Example usage:

  ./usage_analyzer_cmd.py -f e_coli.gb -m amino_acid_usage -x both -o output.txt

    Reads the annotated E. coli genome from e_coli.gb, calculates amino acid usage for all coding sequences, ignoring both stop codons and ambiguous codons, and outputs the results to the file output.txt.
